title: HiKey960/970 onboard USB GPIO Hub

maintainers:

description: |
  Supports the onboard USB GPIO hub found on HiKey960/970.
  The HUB, which acts as a role-switch intermediary to detect the state of
  the USB-C port, to switch the hub into dual-role USB-C or host mode,
  which enables the onboard USB-A host ports.

  Schematics about the hub can be found here:

      describe hadware connections between USB endpoints.
      Two ports are supported: the first being the endpoint that will
      be notified by this driver, and the second being the endpoint
      that notifies this driver of a role switch.
